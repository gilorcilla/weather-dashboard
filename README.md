### Test

Given a weather dashboard with form inputs

When I search for a city

Then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

When I view current weather conditions for that city

Then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

Then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

When I view future weather conditions for that city

Then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

When I click on a city in the search history

Then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
